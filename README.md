# TrackMouseMovement
Small PoC program to detect user activity via mouse cursor movement on the screen in an attempt to evade sandboxing

## Prior to Compiling
- Change number of tracked mouse movements and length of timer to desired values
- Replace `Process.Start("calc.exe");` with legitimate payload logic
- Comment out or remove any `Console.WriteLine();` code after testing
